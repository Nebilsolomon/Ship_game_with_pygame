# Ship_game_with_pygame

If the Aliens reach the bottom of the screen OR touch the ship, the number of ships should decrease, the fleet should be recreated,and the game should restart. If the ship destroys all of the Aliens, a new fleet will be created, that moves faster than before.If the number of ships reaches 0, the game is over. Lasers should blow up Aliens, and cause the score to increase The sounds of firing lasers, and blowing up Aliens or Ships should be heard.
If the score exceeds the high score, the high score should also increase. The high score should be saved to the hard disk. The Scoreboard should show the Ships that remain, the highest score reached, the current score, and the current level.
